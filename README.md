# Engagement Comic

This comic was made by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) to explain how DP-3T works to a wider audience. It is simplified for communication, and not an exact representation of the protocol. For example, the low cost version of the protocol does not allow you to choose the times you upload, whereas the higher cost one using Cuckoo filters does (as per version April 8).

The original URL you can use to easily view the comic is https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/. The whole website is in the public domain, licensed CC-0, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ncase/ncase.github.io).

It is also important to note that the comic does display aspects that go beyond our protocol's specifications, such as a risk score being linked to an instruction to stay at home, a toy example of what a local risk calculation algorithm might look like. While our protocol is engineered to protect privacy, and to help protect a wide range of liberties from function creep, it requires thoughtful deployment in an environment with informed and human rights protective policies in order to work for all members of our communities. The comic should therefore not be read as providing policy suggestions beyond the protocol from the DP-3T team.

We would like help *translating the comic*! Please translate (fonts are Patrick Hand and Open Sans) and if you send the files or notify m.veale@ucl.ac.uk, we will upload them to the repo for others to use. If possible, we would appreciate you also licensing your translations CC-0.
